# Installation
## Windows
[Click here to download the Windows installer.](https://github.com/Apsu/Canary/releases/download/v1.0/Canary.zip)

After doing that, go to File Explorer and unzip the file. One way you can do this is by right-clicking the file and selecting "Extract All" from the
dropdown menu. Enter the new folder, double click `setup.exe` and go through the installer. The layout should now be installed - restarting is a
good idea but might not be necessary.

## MacOS
[Click here to download the MacOS installer.](https://github.com/Apsu/Canary/releases/download/v1.0/Canary.dmg)

Double click on the dmg file you downloaded and follow the directions.

## Linux
[Click here to download the Linux XKB file.](https://github.com/Apsu/Canary/releases/download/v1.0/canary)

Open a terminal. Run `sudo mv Downloads/canary /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols`. Now you can run `setxkbmap canary` to set your current layout
to Canary.
