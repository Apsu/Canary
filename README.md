# Canary

Welcome to the Canary Keyboard Layout!

This layout is the result of collaboration between many of the top layout creators from the AKL (Alternate Keyboard Layout) community, and reflects a lot of different ideas and optimization strategies combined together into one.

We are publicly releasing this in conjunction with a typing tournament, and in partnership with MonkeyType. Please refer to the contact links at the bottom for how to get in touch or participate.

## Design

Canary is based on a few core concepts that have been seen in various layouts, combined together in a novel way. Terminology used is defined below for reference.

### The primary guiding principle is **High Rolls**

Compared to most layouts that don't also sacrifice SFBs or Redirects, Canary has extremely high total Rolls -- over 55% of all Trigrams. This gives it a very "flowy" feel compared to layouts with high Alternates.

It does not overly emphasize inward-rolls over outward-rolls, or vice versa. While there is some conventional wisdom that in-rolls are easier or faster, this is anecdotal at best, and many us feel any benefit is quickly overcome with use.

As a result, the home-row represents a mixture of both rolling directions, though it does emphasize in-rolls a bit more. This is accomplished by having `T` on the left index and `N` on the right. These letters are very high frequency, but they also are most common *after* many other consonants or vowels, so they will often be the target of rolling sequences on that hand.

> Bigram: A sequence of two keys (not containing space)
>
> Trigram: A sequence of three keys (not containing space)
>
> SFB: Same Finger Bigram; a bigram that requires the same finger for both keys
>
> Roll: Trigram which starts on one hand, and progresses to the other hand in one overall direction
>
> Redirect: A trigram which changes direction
>
> Alternate: A trigram which changes hands twice
