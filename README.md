# Canary

Welcome to the Canary Keyboard Layout!

This layout is the result of collaboration between many of the top layout creators from the AKL (Alternate Keyboard Layout) community, and reflects a lot of different ideas and optimization strategies combined together into one.

Downloads of premade layouts for Windows, Mac, and Linux are available from the Releases page.

We are publicly releasing this in conjunction with a typing tournament, and in partnership with MonkeyType. Please refer to the contact links at the bottom for how to get in touch or participate.

## Layout

Here is the layout as-designed to be used with [Angle Mod](#angle-mod) on a [Row Stagger](#row-stagger) (standard) keyboard:

```
w l y p k z x o u ; [ ] \
 c r s t b f n e i a '
  j v d g q m h / , .
```

And here is a version that can be used on [Ortho](#ortho) keyboards:

```
w l y p b z f o u '
c r s t g m n e i a
q j v d k x h / , .
```

Since most people using these boards will be uploading their own custom firmware, we are not suggesting how to solve for placing other keys such as `;[]\`.

## Design

Canary is based on a few core concepts that have been seen in various layouts, combined together in a novel way. Terminology used is defined below for reference.

### The primary guiding principle is **High Rolls**

Compared to most layouts that don't also sacrifice SFBs or Redirects, Canary has extremely high total Rolls -- over 55% of all Trigrams. This gives it a very "flowy" feel compared to layouts with high Alternates.

It does not overly emphasize inward-rolls over outward-rolls, or vice versa. While there is some conventional wisdom that in-rolls are easier or faster, this is anecdotal at best, and many us feel any benefit is quickly overcome with use.

As a result, the home-row represents a mixture of both rolling directions, though it does emphasize in-rolls a bit more. This is accomplished by having `T` on the left index and `N` on the right. These letters are very high frequency, but they also are most common *after* many other consonants or vowels, so they will often be the target of rolling sequences on that hand.

> Bigram: A sequence of two keys (not containing space)
>
> Trigram: A sequence of three keys (not containing space)
>
> SFB: Same Finger Bigram; a bigram that requires the same finger for both keys
>
> Roll: Trigram which starts on one hand, and progresses to the other hand in one overall direction
>
> Redirect: A trigram which changes direction
>
> Alternate: A trigram which changes hands twice
